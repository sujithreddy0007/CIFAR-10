# CIFAR-10
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset â€” a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes . The model uses convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for final classification.
